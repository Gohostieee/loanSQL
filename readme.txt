#hey! welcome to this little project i made, it isnt anything thats really serious? its just a dumb little thing i made
#its a practice scenario where i wanted to mess around with object oriented programming in order to get a better hang of it
#i already had practice with objects and i understood them pretty well but yk it doesnt hurt to practicess
# however i have zero clue how loans work so im pretty certain this thing doesnt work
# its not a bug its just me genuinely having 0 clue what im even supposed to do
# comparing it to actual loan calculators annually it seems fine? but monthly its completely off
